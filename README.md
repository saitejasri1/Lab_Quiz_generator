# Lab_Quiz_generator

## Why this project?
_I am a Teaching assistant for Physics Mechanics Lab where i need to conduct exams and quizzes for my student for the fall semester. I am lazy and don't want to stress out and save some time for my academics as I am currently pursuing my masters._

## Tech stack:
  + Python
  + RAG Framework
  + Javascript
  + HTML, CSS 
  + Flask

## Code Sample
This code sample is a Python-based application that generates customizable quizzes for physics lab sessions using a large language model (LLM) like Gemini 1.5 Flash Pro via API calls. The quizzes can be tailored based on the number of questions and difficulty level (low, medium, hard). The application is built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to generate quizzes quickly and efficiently. It also includes instant scoring features to provide immediate feedback to students upon quiz completion. 

## Difficulties faced:
While working on this project, I learned a lot about integrating LLMs with web apps using API calls to automate content generation. I got hands-on experience with Flask for backend development and improved my skills in combining it with frontend tech like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user-friendly interface. I also figured out how to add customizable features and instant scoring, which are key to making educational tools more efficient and effective.
